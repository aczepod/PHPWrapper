\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-O\-N\-T\-O\-L\-O\-G\-Y}}\-: {\itshape Ontology}. An ontology is a graph structure composed of nodes related by a series of directed edges, each node represents a concept that can be used to illustrate a characteristic or feature of an object, or to tag a set of data elements that are measurements of that feature. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Namespaces}. Namespaces are terms which are containers for a set of term identifiers or names based on their functionality or semantic origin. Such terms are used to allow the disambiguation of homonym identifiers residing in different namespaces. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Predicates}. Predicates are terms which are used to link a subject vertex to an object vertex into a relationship or graph directed edge. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-A\-T\-T\-R\-I\-B\-U\-T\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Attributes}. Attributes or properties are the elements that comprise an object, these may represent categories, descriptions or features. In this ontology, attributes are implemented by a term, which represents the attribute definition, a node, which represents the attribute description and the tag, which represents the attribute name. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-E\-N\-U\-M\-E\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N\-S}}\-: {\itshape Enumerations}. Enumerations are terms which represent elements of a controlled vocabulary or enumerated set. Enumeration term local identifiers can be used in local scope, while their global identifier can unambiguously be used in any scope. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Attribute categories}\-: These terms represent the main categories to which the attributes belong\-:

\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-E\-R\-E\-N\-C\-E}}\-: {\itshape Reference}. Reference attributes allow the identification and retrieval of related objects. This type of relationship differs from the graph kind of relationships in that the object embeds the reference to the other object and does not attach a predicate to the link. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-C\-L\-A\-S\-S\-I\-F\-I\-C\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N}}\-: {\itshape Classification}. Classification attributes are categorical qualifications that group objects around a series of indicators or aggregators. These indicators are generally used as summary keys. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-I\-L\-L\-U\-S\-T\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N}}\-: {\itshape Illustration}. Illustration attributes are used to provide definition, description or qualitative information for an object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-A\-U\-T\-H\-O\-R\-S\-H\-I\-P}}\-: {\itshape Authorship}. Authorship attributes are used to indicate the origin, provenance or authority for an object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S}}\-: {\itshape Status}. Status attributes indicate the state, level or outcome of an object or an event. These attributes are also used to provide statistical information. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Enumeration categories}\-: These terms represent the main categories of enumerated sets\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Types}. A type is a generalised qualification applied to an object. In general this kind of terms will be used to indicate a data type, scale or unit. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D\-S}}\-: {\itshape Kinds}. A kind is similar to a type, except that while the type is general, the kind is specific to the class of the object. Kinds are used to cluster objects of the same class 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape States}. State terms indicate the status, condition or state of an object or event. These classifications are generally used to qualify the outcome of an operation. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-O\-P\-E\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R\-S}}\-: {\itshape Operators}. Operators indicate an operation type, they require a subject operand and often relate the subject to an object operand. Operators are predicates, except that they always produce a result. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Type categories}\-: These terms represent the type categories\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-P\-R\-I\-M\-I\-T\-I\-V\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Primitives}. Primitive types are scalar data types that represent base types from which all other composite types are constituted. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-U\-C\-T\-U\-R\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Structures}. Structures are nested collections of primitive data types. The data type refers to the structure, not to the individual primitives 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-E\-N\-U\-M\-E\-R\-A\-T\-E\-D}}\-: {\itshape Enumerated}. Enumerated type values must be selected among a finite set of values or from a controlled vocabulary. Attributes of this type are validated by the set domain. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-C\-A\-R\-D\-I\-N\-A\-L\-I\-T\-Y}}\-: {\itshape Cardinality}. Cardinality types are used in conjunction with other types, they indicate whether the value is required or whether the value is a list. This type acts as a modifier for the other types. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-R\-E\-L\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N\-S\-H\-I\-P}}\-: {\itshape Relationship}. Relationship types enumerate the different kinds of relation, they qualify the relationship flow.

Kind definitions.

This file contains the term global identifiers of the default node and term kind enumerations.

Ontology terms and nodes have a category called {\itshape kind} which represents the function of the term or node within the ontology\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-R\-O\-O\-T}}\-: Root. This represents a door or entry point of an ontology. It can be either the node from which the whole graph or tree originates from, or a node that represents a specific thematic entry point. In general, such objects will be used as elements of an index to an ontology. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-F\-E\-A\-T\-U\-R\-E}}\-: Feature . This kind of object defines a feature, property or attribute of an object that can be described or measured. This kind of node will generally be found as a leaf of the structure describing an object. Plant height is a plant characteristic that belongs to the category of morphological traits\-: the latter is not a feature, while plant height is. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-M\-E\-T\-H\-O\-D}}\-: Method node. This kind of node is required whenever an object's feature can be measured in different ways or with different workflows without becoming a different feature. Plant height is an attribute of a plant which can be measured after a month or at flowering time; the attribute is the same, but the method is different. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-S\-C\-A\-L\-E}}\-: Scale node. This kind of node describes in what unit or scale a measurement is expressed in. Plant height may be measured in centimeters or inches, as well as in intervals or finite categories. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-T\-A\-N\-C\-E}}\-: Instance node. In general, ontology nodes represent metadata, in some cases nodes may represent actual data\-: an instance node is a node that represents the metadata and data of an object. An I\-S\-O 3166 country code can be considered an enumeration node that constitutes the metadata for the country it represents, but if you store data regarding that country in the node, this may become also an instance node, because it represents the object it defines. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-E\-N\-U\-M\-E\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N}}\-: Enumeration. This kind of node describes a controlled vocabulary element. These nodes derive from scale nodes and represent the valid choices of enumeration and enumerated set scale nodes. An I\-S\-O 3166 country code could be considered an enumeration node. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E}}\-: Namespace. This kind of term represents a namespace, semantic group or I\-D space. Terms of this kind will generally be used to group identifiers. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E}}\-: Predicate. This kind of term represents a predicate, or element which connects subject and object vertices into a relationship. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-S\-Y\-M\-M\-E\-T\-R\-I\-C}}\-: Symmetric predicate. This kind of term represents a predicate which relates two terms in both directions. By default, relationships are directional, that is they originate from the subject towards the object, but not in the opposite direction\-: this kind of predicate, instead, does not have the concept of direction, the relationship flows in both directions.

Predicate definitions.

This file contains the term global identifiers of the default predicates.

Predicates are represented by a term object and serve as connectors between two vertex nodes, these are the default predicates\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-S\-U\-B\-C\-L\-A\-S\-S\-\_\-\-O\-F}}\-: {\itshape Subclass of}. This predicate
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item indicates that the subject of the relationship is a subclass of the object of the relationship, in other words, the subject is derived from the object. This predicate is equivalent to the {\ttfamily I\-S-\/\-A} predicate, it states that the subject is an instance of the object. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-S\-U\-B\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-O\-F}}\-: {\itshape Subset of}. This predicate indicates that the subject of the relationship represents a subset of the object of the relationship, in other words, the subject is a subset of the object, or the subject is contained by the object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-A\-T\-T\-R\-I\-B\-U\-T\-E\-\_\-\-O\-F}}\-: {\itshape Attribute of}. This predicate indicates that the subject of the relationship is an attribute of the object of the relationship, this means that the subject of the relationship should be of the \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-F\-E\-A\-T\-U\-R\-E} kind. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-S\-C\-A\-L\-E\-\_\-\-O\-F}}\-: {\itshape Scale of}. This predicate is used by scale vertices to connect feature or trait vertices, the subject of the relationship represents a scale or unit and the predicate indicates that the object of the relationship uses that scale or unit. This predicate is specifically used to indicate the different scales in which a feature ir trait vertex can be expressed in. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-M\-E\-T\-H\-O\-D\-\_\-\-O\-F}}\-: {\itshape Method of}. This predicate relates method vertices with feature vertices or other methods, it indicates that the subject of the relationship is a method, or workflow variation of the object of the relationship. This predicate is used to connect the pipeline of modifiers applied to a feature vertex. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-E\-N\-U\-M\-\_\-\-O\-F}}\-: {\itshape Enumeration of}. This predicate relates vertex elements of an enumerated set, it indicates that the subject of the relationship is an enumerated set element instance, and if the object of the relationship is also an enumerated set element instance, this means that the subject is a subset of the object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-F\-E\-R\-R\-E\-D}}\-: {\itshape Preferred choice}. This predicate indicates that the object of the relationship is the preferred choice, in other words, if possible, one should use the object of the relationship in place of the subject. This predicate will be used in general by obsolete or deprecated items. The scope of this predicate is similar to the \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-V\-A\-L\-I\-D} predicate, except that in this case the use of the subject of the relationship is only deprecated, while in the \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-V\-A\-L\-I\-D} predicate it is not valid. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-V\-A\-L\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Valid choice}. This predicate indicates that the object of the relationship is the valid choice, in other words, the subject of the relationship is obsolete or not valid, and one should use the object of the relationship in its place. This predicate will be used in general to store obsolete or deprecated versions. The scope of this predicate is similar to the \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-F\-E\-R\-R\-E\-D} predicate, except that in this case the use of the subject of the relationship is invalid, while in the \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-F\-E\-R\-R\-E\-D} predicate it is only deprecated. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-L\-E\-G\-A\-C\-Y}}\-: {\itshape Legacy version}. This predicate indicates that the object of the relationship is the former or legacy choice, in other words, the object of the relationship is obsolete or not valid. This predicate will be used in general to record historical information. The scope of this predicate is similar to the \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-F\-E\-R\-R\-E\-D} and \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-V\-A\-L\-I\-D} predicates, except that in this case the legacy choice might not be invalid, nor deprecated\-: it only means that the object of the relationship was used in the past and the subject of the relationship is currently used in its place. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-X\-R\-E\-F}}\-: {\itshape Cross reference}. This predicate indicates that the subject of the relationship is related to the object of the relationship. This predicate will be found generally in both directions and does not represent any specific type of relationship, other than what the edge object attributes may indicate. The scope of this predicate is similar to the \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-X\-R\-E\-F\-\_\-\-E\-X\-A\-C\-T} predicate, except that the latter indicates that the object of the relationship can be used in place of the subject, while in this predicate this is not necessarily true. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-X\-R\-E\-F\-\_\-\-E\-X\-A\-C\-T}}\-: {\itshape Exact cross reference}. This predicate indicates that the object of the relationship can be used in place of the subject of the relationship. If the predicate is found in both directions, one could say that the two vertices are identical, except for their formal representation. The scope of this predicate is similar to the X\-R\-E\-F predicate, except that the latter only indicates that both vertices are related, this predicate indicates that they are interchangeable.

Type definitions.

This file contains the default data types.

Types are represented by term objects, they indicate the type of an object and are organised in the following enumerated set\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Primitive data types}\-: These types represent primitive or atomic data types, which means that these cannot be decomposed in elementary components. 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-A\-N\-Y}}\-: {\itshape Any type}. This type represents a type wildcard, it qualifies an attribute that can take any type of value. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G}}\-: {\itshape String or text}. This type defines a list of characters or a list of character strings. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-I\-N\-T}}\-: {\itshape Integer number}. This type defines an integer signed number, this number does not have a decimal part and has an indeterminate precision. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-F\-L\-O\-A\-T}}\-: {\itshape Floating point number}. This type defines a signed floating point numeric value of indeterminate precision. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-B\-O\-O\-L\-E\-A\-N}}\-: {\itshape Boolean switch}. This type defines a switch that can take two values\-: {\ttfamily O\-N} and {\ttfamily O\-F\-F}. By default we assume it to be represented by a number in which zero is {\ttfamily O\-F\-F} and any other value is {\ttfamily O\-N}. Other representations are {\ttfamily yes}/{\ttfamily no}, {\ttfamily true}/{\ttfamily false}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Custom primitive data types}\-: These types are variations of primitive data types, they represent specific sub-\/types of primitive data types. 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-B\-I\-N\-A\-R\-Y\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G}}\-: {\itshape Binary string}. This type represents a list of bytes. It is equivalent to the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} type, except that the characters that compose the string can take any value, while in the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} type they represent specifically text characters. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G}}\-: {\itshape Date string}. This type represents a date in the form of a {\ttfamily Y\-Y\-Y\-Y\-M\-M\-D\-D} string in which missing elements should be omitted. This means that if we don't know the day we can express that date as {\ttfamily Y\-Y\-Y\-Y\-M\-M} and if we don't know the month we can express it as {\ttfamily Y\-Y\-Y\-Y}. This type is functionally identical to a \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} type, except that its elements can only be digits and their structure is known. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-T\-I\-M\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G}}\-: {\itshape Time string}. This type is a combination of the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} type followed by a structure of three elements representing the hours, minutes and seconds separated by colons, {\ttfamily Y\-Y\-Y\-Y\-M\-M\-D\-D H\-H\-M\-M\-S\-S}. Missing elements are omitted, this means that if you don't have the minutes you would have a {\ttfamily Y\-Y\-Y\-Y\-M\-M\-D\-D H\-H} and if you don't have the time it would become and act as a \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} type. This type is functionally identical to a \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} type, except that its elements can only be digits and their structure is known. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-G\-E\-X\-\_\-\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G}}\-: {\itshape Regular expression}. This type represents a regular expression string, it is used to perform complex pattern selections in strings. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-I\-N\-T32}}\-: {\itshape 32 bit integer}. This type defines a 32 bit signed integer, this number ranges from {\ttfamily −9,223,372,036,854,775,808} to {\ttfamily 9,223,372,036,854,775,807}. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-I\-N\-T32}}\-: {\itshape 32 bit integer}. This type defines a 32 bit signed integer, this number ranges from {\ttfamily −2,147,483,648} to {\ttfamily 2,147,483,647}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

This include file contains common offset definitions. Ancestor.

This includes the ancestor class definitions. \subparagraph*{Connection object ancestor}

This {\itshape abstract} class is the ancestor of all connection and container classes in this library, it implements the the common interface shared by derived concrete instances.

A connection object holds a reference to a native connection which can be that to a server, database or container. The class server as a proxy to native implementations, offering a single interface to client objects which will use native derived concrete classes.

The object is instantiated by providing the native connection which is stored in a data member of the object, the array part of the object can be used to store specific attributes of the native connection.

All objects derived from this class must implement the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-\_\-to\-String()} method that will return the specific name of the current connection.

The \hyperlink{}{Connection()} accessor method can be used to manage the native connection and the inherited offset management methods can be used to manage the connection attributes.

The object has its \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Inited()} status set when the native connection has been set in the object.

The class acts as an ancestor of other specialised abstract classes which declare the common interfaces of specific connection types.

The class declares two constants\-: \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E} and \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-P\-A\-R\-E\-N\-T}. The first one corresponds to the internal name of the object, which could also be the public one. The second offset corresponds to the parent connection object\-: if the current object was instantiated by a parent class instance, such as a database by a server, or a container by a database, this offset will contain the creator object. This can be useful if we need, for instance, the database, given the container.

This {\itshape abstract} class is the ancestor of all container classes in this library, it implements the interface and workflow that all concrete derived classes should implement.

A container object serves the purpose of storing and retrieving objects, in the same way as a database table. The object holds a data member that represents a native container from a database.

The class does not implement a concrete data store, derived classes must implement specific storage actions.

This includes the ancestor class definitions. \subparagraph*{Database object ancestor}

This {\itshape abstract} class is the ancestor of all database classes in this library, it implements the interface and workflow that all concrete derived classes should implement.

A database object holds a data member that represents a native connection to a database server, database objects have the ability to generate other connection derived objects that have specific functionality, such as containers.

The object is instantiated by providing the native database connection which is stored in a data member of the object, the array part of the object can be used to store specific attributes of the native database connection.

The class features an offset, \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-P\-A\-R\-E\-N\-T}, that can be used to store the parent object, in this case the server object. This member gets set when the object is instantiated by a server object.

The abstract class must be overloaded by concrete classes that implement a native database object.

This include file contains all local definitions to this class. \subparagraph*{Data wrapper}

This class overloads its ancestor to implement the framework for providing services that store and request data. The class does not feature a concrete data store engine, so it only concentrates in providing the framework for derived classes that implement concrete data store instances, for this reason this class is abstract.

{\itshape This class is the ancestor common to most classes in this library, it extends \hyperlink{}{Array\-Object} to implement an object which represents a collection of key/value attributes.}

{\itshape The object implements the \hyperlink{}{Array\-Access} interface in which the following rules are enforced\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item No offset may have the {\ttfamily N\-U\-L\-L} value, setting an offset to that value is equivalent to removing the offset. 
\item It is legal to retrieve a non-\/existant offset, a {\ttfamily N\-U\-L\-L} value will be returned and no notice issued. 
\item It is legal to delete a non-\/existant offset, no notice or warning will be issued. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape An edge is an element of a tree or graph that connects two vertices through a predicate, it represents a subject/predicate/object triplet in which the direction of the relation flows from the subject towards the object.}

{\itshape Objects of this class feature three main properties\-:}

{\itshape

\item {\itshape Subject vertex}\-: The subject vertex, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Subject()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-U\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T}} tag, represents the start or origin of a relationship, it is constituted by the reference to a \hyperlink{class_c_node}{C\-Node} instance, using the node's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}. This attribute is required. 
\item {\itshape Relationship predicate}\-: The predicate, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Predicate()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E}} tag, represents the connection between the start and end of the relationship, it is constituted by a reference to a \hyperlink{class_c_term}{C\-Term} instance, using the term's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}.

{\itshape }

{\itshape A node is an element of a tree or graph which is connected to other nodes through edges, a node is a vertex of a relationship. This class concentrates in the core features of the node, without taking into consideration the connections to other nodes.}

{\itshape The class features the following default properties\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Term}\-: The term, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Term()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}} tag, is a reference to a \hyperlink{class_c_term}{C\-Term} instance which holds the static attributes of the current node. This attribute is constituted by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} of the referenced term and is required. 
\item {\itshape Category}\-: The category, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Category()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-C\-A\-T\-E\-G\-O\-R\-Y}} tag, is an enumerated set of values that constitute the category or classification to which the object referred by the current node belongs to. This attribute is optional. 
\item {\itshape Kind}\-: The kind, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Kind()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D}} tag, is an enumerated set of values that define the function of the node. This attribute is optional. 
\item {\itshape Type}\-: The type, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Type()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E}} tag, is an enumerated set of values that represent the type of the object defined by the current node. This attribute will be in general a combination of elements describing two main attribute categories\-: the data type and the cardinality. This attribute is optional. 
\item {\itshape Description}\-: The description, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Description()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-E\-S\-C\-R\-I\-P\-T\-I\-O\-N}} tag, represents the description or long label of the node. This attribute is constituted by an array of elements in which the value of the element represents the description string and the element key is the language code in which the description is expressed in. This attribute is optional. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape The node's main property is the term, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}, which defines the abstract concept that the node represents\-: a term taken by itself is an abstract concept, when it is referenced from a node which is related to other nodes through predicates, this term takes a different meaning, it becomes a term in context. Terms are like vocabulary, taken out of context they have a generalised meaning; put in context, they take a different meaning depending in what position of a term chain they are positioned. In this class, terms may hold any value.}

{\itshape The node also features a \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D} property which is an enumerated set describing the specific type, or the specific function of the node in its chain or path.}

{\itshape Finally, the class features the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E} property which defines the data type of the node or the data unit it represents, this offset is an enumerated set in which two elements can reside\-: the data type or unit, which is required, and optionally one or both \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-I\-R\-E\-D} and \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-A\-R\-R\-A\-Y} which respectively indicate whether the node represents a required attribute and whether the data type indicated in the first element of the offset is a list or not.}

{\itshape This class does not feature attributes that can represent the unique identifier of the object, this means that the container is responsible of providing the primary key of the object.}

{\itshape Nodes can be considered \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Inited()} when they have the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M} offset set. This and the other properties can be changed at any time, none are locked once the object has been committed\-: it is the responsibility of the caller or of derived classes to implement a locking rule.}

{\itshape The class features member accessor methods for the default offsets\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{}{Term()}\-: This method manages the node's term, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}. 
\item \hyperlink{}{Kind()}\-: This method manages the node's kind, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D}. 
\item \hyperlink{}{Type()}\-: This method manages the node's type, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E}.

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Terms}\-: These elements are represented in this library by the instances of the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{C\-Ontology\-Term} class, they represent concepts whose meaning is independent from their context. These objects may carry any number or type of attributes, the default ones which are managed by this library are the following\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Local identifier}. This attribute contains the local unique identifier. This value represents the value that uniquely identifies an object within a specific domain or namespace. It is by definition a string constituting the suffix of the global identifier, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Global identifier}. This attribute contains the global unique identifier. This value represents the value that uniquely identifies the object across domains and namespaces. This value is by definition a string and will generally constitute the object's primary key (\hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}) in full or hashed form. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E}}\-: {\itshape Namespace}. This attribute is a reference to a term which represents the namespace of the current object. The object local identifiers must be unique within the scope of the namespace. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-Y\-N\-O\-N\-Y\-M\-S}}\-: {\itshape Synonyms}. This attribute contains a list of strings that represent alternate identifiers for the hosting object. Synonyms do not have any relation to the namespace. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}}\-: {\itshape Term}. This attribute contains a reference to an object that represents the term of the attribute host. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D}}\-: {\itshape Kind}. This attribute is an enumerated set that defines the kind of the hosting object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-A\-B\-E\-L}}\-: {\itshape Label}. This attribute represents the label, name or short description of the referenced object. It is a \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-L\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} structure in which the label can be expressed in several languages. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-E\-F\-I\-N\-I\-T\-I\-O\-N}}\-: {\itshape Definition}. This attribute represents the definition of the referenced object. It is an \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-L\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} structure in which the definition can be expressed in several languages. This attribute is similar to a description, except that the latter depends on the context, which is why it belongs to nodes, while the definition does not depend on the context, which is why it belongs to terms. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Nodes}. This attribute is a collection of node references, it is an array of node object native identifiers who reference the current object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-F\-E\-A\-T\-U\-R\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Features}. This attribute is a collection of feature references, it is an array of object native identifiers that reference the current object as a feature or trait. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-M\-E\-T\-H\-O\-D\-S}}\-: {\itshape Methods}. This attribute is a collection of method references, it is an array of object native identifiers that reference the current object as a method or modifier. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-C\-A\-L\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Scales}. This attribute is a collection of scale references, it is an array of object native identifiers that reference the current object as a scale or unit. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-S}}\-: {\itshape Namespace references count}. This integer attribute counts how many times external objects have referenced the current one as a namespace. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Nodes}\-: These elements are represented in this library by the instances of the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_node}{C\-Ontology\-Node} class, they represent concepts whose meaning is dependant from their context and require a reference to a term object. In a sense, nodes represent terms in context. These objects may carry any number or type of attributes, the default ones which are managed by this library are the following\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}}\-: {\itshape Term}. This attribute contains a reference to an object that represents the term of the attribute host.

\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-C\-A\-T\-E\-G\-O\-R\-Y}}\-: {\itshape Category}. This attribute is an enumerated set that contains all the categories to which the hosting object belongs to. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D}}\-: {\itshape Kind}. This attribute is an enumerated set that defines the kind of the hosting object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E}}\-: {\itshape Type}. This attribute is an enumerated set that contains a combination of data type and cardinality indicators which, combined, represet the data type of the hosting object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-E\-S\-C\-R\-I\-P\-T\-I\-O\-N}}\-: {\itshape Description}. This attribute represents the description of the referenced object. It is an \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-L\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G} structure in which the description can be expressed in several languages. This attribute is similar to a definition, except that the latter does not depend on the context, which is why it belongs to nodes, while the description depends on the context, which is why it belongs to nodes. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Nodes}. This attribute is a collection of node references, it is an array of node object native identifiers who reference the current object. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-E\-D\-G\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Edges}. This attribute is a collection of edge references, it is an array of edge object native identifiers who reference the current object. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Edges}\-: These elements are represented in this library by the instances of the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_edge}{C\-Ontology\-Edge} class, they represent relationships between node objects connected by a predicate term. They represent a subject/predicate/object triplet which connects all elements of the graph. These objects may carry any number or type of attributes, the default ones which are managed by this library are the following\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Global identifier}. This attribute contains the global unique identifier. This value represents the value that uniquely identifies the object across domains and namespaces.

\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-U\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Unique identifier}. This attribute contains the hashed unique identifier of an object in which its \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} is not related to the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}. This is generally used when the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} is a sequence number. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-U\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T}}\-: {\itshape Subject}. This attribute contains a reference to an object that represents the start, origin or subject vertex of a {\ttfamily subject}/{\ttfamily predicate}/{\ttfamily object} relationship. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-O\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T}}\-: {\itshape Object}. This attribute contains a reference to an object that represents the end, destination or object vertex of a {\ttfamily subject}/{\ttfamily predicate}/{\ttfamily object} relationship. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E}}\-: {\itshape Predicate}. This attribute contains a reference to an object that represents the predicate term of a {\ttfamily subject}/{\ttfamily predicate}/{\ttfamily object} relationship. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Tags}\-: These elements are represented in this library by the instances of the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{C\-Ontology\-Tag} class, they represent paths between a starting node called {\itshape feature}, which represents the feature or trait to be tagged, and an ending node called {\itshape scale} which represents the scale or unit in which the feature is measured or described. Tags are the objects used to tie the ontology to data, these objects are literally used to tag datasets. These objects may carry any number or type of attributes, the default ones which are managed by this library are the following\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Global identifier}. This attribute contains the global unique identifier. This value represents the value that uniquely identifies the object across domains and namespaces. This value is by definition a string and will generally constitute the object's primary key (\hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}) in full or hashed form. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-U\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Unique identifier}. This attribute contains the hashed unique identifier of an object in which its \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} is not related to the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}. This is generally used when the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} is a sequence number. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H}}\-: {\itshape Path}. This attribute represents a sequence of {\ttfamily vertex}, {\ttfamily predicate}, {\ttfamily vertex} elements whose concatenation represents a path between an origin vertex and a destination vertex. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape All four collections share the following two attributes\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}}\-: {\itshape Native identifier}. This attribute contains the native unique identifier of the object. This identifier is used as the default unique key for all objects and can have any scalar data type. 
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-C\-L\-A\-S\-S}}\-: {\itshape Class}. This attribute is a string that represets the referenced object's class. This attribute is used to instantiate the correct class once an object has been retrieved from its container.

{\itshape They are a separate node which shares the same \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M} attribute as the node they point to, but have a subset of the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-C\-A\-T\-E\-G\-O\-R\-Y}, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D} and \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E} attributes.}

{\itshape These objects can be used as a view into the master graph formed by the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_master_vertex}{C\-Ontology\-Master\-Vertex} instances, nodes which do not have the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E} attribute.}

{\itshape The main use of such objects is to create a separate graph using a subset of the master graph elements, so that when navigating the elements, only a subset of the relationships is displayed, in order to limit the scope of the graph to a specific category or realm.}

{\itshape Whenever a new node is created, the class will make sure that an instance of \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_master_vertex}{C\-Ontology\-Master\-Vertex} exists which points to the same term as the current object and set the current node's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E} attribute to point to it.

{\itshape When an instance of this class is related to another instance of this class, the same relation will be automatically created between the master nodes referenced by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E} attribute; this will not occur if an instance of this class is related to a master node.}

\item {\itshape Global identifier}\-: The global identifier, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{G\-I\-D()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}} tag, in this class is generated by concatenating the subject node's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}, the predicate term's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D} and the object node's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}, all separated by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-I\-N\-D\-E\-X\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token.

{\itshape When adding vertices and predicates to the object, these can be provided as objects and if these objects are not committed, they will be stored before the current edge object is committed.}

{\itshape The class implements the static method, \hyperlink{}{Default\-Container()}, which, given a database, will return the default edges container; it will use the \hyperlink{}{k\-C\-O\-N\-T\-A\-I\-N\-E\-R\-\_\-\-E\-D\-G\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E} constant as the container name. Note that when passing \hyperlink{class_c_connection}{C\-Connection} based objects to the persisting methods of this class, you should provide preferably database instances, since this class may have to commit nodes and terms.}

{\itshape Note that when relating nodes from the node object, you have the option of automatically relating eventual alias master nodes, here this is not implemented on purpose (code is there, but commented), because there is no easy way of providing a parameter to prevent it.}

At commit time, \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Precommit\-Related()}, we commit the eventual term instance and check if the value provided to the \hyperlink{}{Term()} member accessor is a term reference; we also manage its \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E\-S} attribute by adding or removing the current node's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} from the term's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E\-S} list depending on whether the term was referenced or the node deleted. 
\item {\itshape Type}\-: The type, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Type()}} or the inherited {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E}} tag, in this class is required to belong to a specific set of values, the \hyperlink{}{Type()} method's documentation lists them.

\item {\itshape Graph nodes}\-: If the node container features the \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-G\-R\-A\-P\-H} offset, this means that the server is also connected to a graph storage engine, in that case a new node will be created in the graph container, \hyperlink{class_c_graph_container}{C\-Graph\-Container}, and the current object will use its identifier as the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} attribute.

{\itshape }

{\itshape This class extends its ancestor, \hyperlink{class_c_tag}{C\-Tag}, by asserting the type of objects passed to the path, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H}, and by using term references as the elements of the object's path and global identifier.}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Path}\-: As in the parent class, this attribute collects graph vertices and the predicates that connect them. The odd elements are expected to be vertex nodes of graph and the even elements the predicate terms that connect them. In this class the vertices are represented by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M} reference of the vertex \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_node}{C\-Ontology\-Node} instances, while the predicates are represented by the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{C\-Ontology\-Term} \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} of the predicate terms. 
\item {\itshape Global identifier}\-: The global identifier, \hyperlink{}{G\-I\-D()}, in this class is represented by the concatenation of the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D} attributes of all the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{C\-Ontology\-Term} instance references of the object's path, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H}, separated by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-I\-N\-D\-E\-X\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token. 
\item {\itshape Unique identifier}\-: The unique identifier, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-U\-I\-D}, in this class is represented by the hash of the global identifier. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape Elements of the path can be provided as committed objects, they must have their \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} set. \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_node}{C\-Ontology\-Node} instances or references can only be provided as odd elements, while \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{C\-Ontology\-Term} instances or references can be provided as both odd or even elements. Note that nodes will always be resolved into the terms they refer to, so {\itshape there there is no direct relationship between nodes and tags}.}

{\itshape This particular behaviour allows for different graph paths to share the same tag, which allows duplicating ontologies for use as templates, or preventing duplicate data types from being tagged differently. It also allows the same vertex elements to be treated differently if their predicates differ.}

{\itshape Objects of this class will almost always be created by providing a sequence of node vertices and predicate terms, the \hyperlink{}{Push\-Item()} method will follow these rules\-: the first element of the path is the feature vertex, if provided as an \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_node}{C\-Ontology\-Node} instance, it must have its \hyperlink{}{C\-Ontology\-Node\-::\-Kind()} set to \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-F\-E\-A\-T\-U\-R\-E}; the last element of the path is the scale vertex, if provided as an \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_node}{C\-Ontology\-Node} instance, it must have its \hyperlink{}{C\-Ontology\-Node\-::\-Kind()} set to \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-S\-C\-A\-L\-E}.}

{\itshape Whenever a tag is committed, the referenced terms will receive the tag \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} in an attribute, depending on their position in the path\-: the first path term will receive the tag reference in the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-F\-E\-A\-T\-U\-R\-E\-S} attribute, the terms which are neither the first nor the last in the path receive the reference in \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-M\-E\-T\-H\-O\-D\-S} and the last term in \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-C\-A\-L\-E\-S}.}

{\itshape This class prevents updating the full object once it has been inserted for the first time. This behaviour is necessary because tags are referenced by many other objects, so updating a full tag object is risky, since it may have been updated elsewhere\-: for this reason the \hyperlink{}{Update()} and \hyperlink{}{Replace()} methods will raise an exception.}

{\itshape Objects of this class use a sequence number as their native identifier, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}, tagged as \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-N\-C\-E\-\_\-\-K\-E\-Y\-\_\-\-T\-A\-G}.}

{\itshape The class implements the static method, \hyperlink{}{Default\-Container()}, which, given a database, will return the default tag container; it will use the \hyperlink{}{k\-C\-O\-N\-T\-A\-I\-N\-E\-R\-\_\-\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E} constant as the container name.}

{\itshape }

{\itshape This class extends its ancestor, \hyperlink{class_c_term}{C\-Term}, by implementing a term object in the context of an ontology.}

{\itshape An ontology term represents a concept unrelated to a context. As a vocabulary word changes its meaning depending on its position in a sentence, the same term may be used in different places in the ontology, meaning in different contexts, to represent different things. This class overloads its ancestor to implement the standards and rules that make it into an ontology term.}

The current term's \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D} is generated by concatenating the namespace's global identifier to the term's local identifier separated by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token. The namespace attribute is constituted by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} of the referenced term and is optional. 
\item {\itshape Namespace references}\-: The namespace references, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-S}} tag, represents either the number or the list of instances of this class that reference the current term as a namespace. This attribute is either an integer or an array, depending on the value of the \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-W\-I\-T\-C\-H\-\_\-k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-S} flag\-:

\item {\ttfamily 0x3}\-: {\itshape Keep list of namespace references}. This means that the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-S} attribute will be a list of references. 
\item {\ttfamily 0x0} {\itshape or other}\-: {\itshape Don't handle this information}. This means that the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-S} attribute will not be handled.

\item {\itshape Node references}\-: The node references, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E\-S}} tag, represents the references to this object from node objects. This attribute behaves like the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-S}} tag, and is managed by the \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-W\-I\-T\-C\-H\-\_\-k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E\-S} switch. 
\item {\itshape Feature tag references}\-: The feature tag references, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-F\-E\-A\-T\-U\-R\-E\-S}} tag, represents references to \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{C\-Ontology\-Tag} instances that reference the current term as a \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-F\-E\-A\-T\-U\-R\-E} feature. It is either the count or an array of \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{C\-Ontology\-Tag} \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} attributes whose first vertex node in their \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H} attribute refers to the current term.

\item {\itshape Method tag references}\-: The method tag references, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-M\-E\-T\-H\-O\-D\-S}} tag, represents references to \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{C\-Ontology\-Tag} instances that reference the current term as a \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-M\-E\-T\-H\-O\-D} method. It is either the count or an array of \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{C\-Ontology\-Tag} \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} attributes whose vertex nodes in their \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H} attribute refer to the current term and are not the first or last in the list.

\item {\itshape Scale tag references}\-: The scale tag references, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-C\-A\-L\-E\-S}} tag, represents references to \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{C\-Ontology\-Tag} instances that reference the current term as a \hyperlink{}{k\-K\-I\-N\-D\-\_\-\-S\-C\-A\-L\-E} scale. It is either the count or an array of \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{C\-Ontology\-Tag} \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} attributes whose last vertex node in their \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H} attribute refers to the current term.

{\itshape }

{\itshape This {\itshape abstract} class extends its \hyperlink{class_c_persistent_document}{C\-Persistent\-Document} ancestor to implement an identification interface that governs how objects derived from this class are identified within their container.}

{\itshape The class adds two new default attributes\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Global identifier}\-: The global identifier, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{G\-I\-D()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}} tag, is a string that represents the unserialised native identifier (\hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}) of the object. 
\item {\itshape Class name}\-: The class name, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Class\-Name()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-C\-L\-A\-S\-S}} tag, is a string that represents the class name of the object. This information is used to instantiate the right class when retrieving objects from a database. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape In this class the object's native identifier, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}, is generated by a static method, \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-id()}, which takes the global identifier, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}, and processes it to generate the native identifier. In this class by default we simply return the provided value as is, in derived classes you might hash the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D} to obtain a shorter \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}.}

{\itshape Once the object has been committed, both the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} and \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D} identifiers are locked by the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Preset()} and \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Preunset()} methods to prevent invalidating object references.}

{\itshape All objects derived from this class should implement the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-\_\-to\-String()} method, by default this class returns the global identifier, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}. Derived classes may change this behaviour, in particular when the class does not feature the global identifier\-: the important thing is to be able to cast an object to a string.}

{\itshape This {\itshape abstract} class is the ancestor of all server classes in this library, it implements the interface and workflow that all concrete derived classes should implement.}

{\itshape A server object holds a data member that represents a native connection to a server environment, server objects have the ability to generate other connection derived objects that have specific functionality, such as databases.}

{\itshape The object is instantiated by providing the native server connection which is stored in a data member of the object, the array part of the object can be used to store specific attributes of the native server connection.}

{\itshape The class also features a second property that can be used to store a concrete instance of the \hyperlink{class_c_graph_container}{C\-Graph\-Container} class using the \hyperlink{}{Graph()} member accessor method. This property will be used by generated \hyperlink{class_c_container}{C\-Container} instances to write both to data containers and graphs.}

{\itshape }

{\itshape This class manages a data member which can be used to track the state of the object.}

{\itshape The status is recorded in a \hyperlink{}{property} that does not belong to the object's array data store. The data member consists of a 4 byte bit field in which the first 31 elements are used to record on/off states.}

{\itshape The class adds an interface to intercept calls to \hyperlink{}{offset\-Set()} and \hyperlink{}{offset\-Unset()} in the event that the value is going to change. The \hyperlink{}{offset\-Set()} method will call the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Preset()} method before performing the change and the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Postset()} method after the change, this only in case of modification. Similarly, the \hyperlink{}{offset\-Unset()} method will call the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Preunset()} method before and the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Postunset()} method after removing an offset only if that offset exists. In this class we set the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Dirty()} status in the event of a value change and use the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Ready()} method to set the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Inited()} status.}

{\itshape The class also implements an interface to handle the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Inited()} status\-: a protected method, \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Ready()}, can be used to return a boolean that indicates whether the object has all the required components, this is performed in the constructor and in the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Postset()} and \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Postunset()} methods. By default the object is considered initialised.}

{\itshape {\itshape Note\-: you should use only the first 31 bits because P\-H\-P tends to cast a bitfield into a 32 bit integer which uses the last bit as the sign.}}

{\itshape A tag object represents a path between two vertices of a graph, it can be used as a reference to that path.}

{\itshape This class features the following default properties\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Path}\-: The tag path, or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H}} tag, represents a sequence of {\itshape vertex}/{\itshape predicate}/{\itshape vertex} elements in which the odd elements represent relationship vertices and the even elements the predicates that connect these vertices. The class offers two methods, \hyperlink{}{Push\-Item()} and \hyperlink{}{Pop\-Item()} which respectively allow to append and remove items from the top of the list. 
\item {\itshape Global identifier}\-: The global identifier, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{G\-I\-D()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}} tag, is constituted by concatenating all the elements of the path attribute, separated by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-I\-N\-D\-E\-X\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape A tag can be considered \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Inited()} when it has at least one element in the path, which represents the minimum legal number of path items.}

{\itshape This class implements the logic to manage these paths without assuming the nature or type of their elements\-: this will be the responsibility of derived classes. In this class all items comprising the path must be convertable to strings}

{\itshape This includes the ancestor class definitions. \subparagraph*{Term object ancestor}}

{\itshape }

{\itshape A term is an object that features the following default properties\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Local identifier}\-: The local identifier, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{L\-I\-D()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-I\-D}} tag, is a string code that uniquely identifies the object among all those sharing the same namespace. This attribute is required. 
\item {\itshape Global identifier}\-: The global identifier, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{G\-I\-D()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-G\-I\-D}} tag, is a string code that uniquely identifies the object among all other objects, regardless of their namespace. This attribute is required and will be generated. 
\item {\itshape Namespace}\-: The namespace, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{N\-S()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E}} tag, is a container for a set of term local identifiers allowing disambiguation or homonym local term identifiers. The current term global identifier is generated by concatenating the namespace global identifier to the term's local identifier separated by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token. This attribute is optional. 
\item {\itshape Label}\-: The label or name, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Label()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-A\-B\-E\-L}} tag, represents the label, name or short description of the term. This attribute is constituted by an array of elements in which the value of the element represents the label string and the element key is the language code in which the label is expressed in. This attribute is optional. 
\item {\itshape Definition}\-: The definition, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Definition()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-E\-F\-I\-N\-I\-T\-I\-O\-N}} tag, represents the definition or long label of the term. This attribute is constituted by an array of elements in which the value of the element represents the definition string and the element key is the language code in which the definition is expressed in. This attribute is optional. 
\item {\itshape Synonyms}\-: The synonym or alias, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Synonym()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-Y\-N\-O\-N\-Y\-M\-S}} tag, represents a list of strings that represent alternative names or identifiers for the term. These strings are comparable to variable names and do not have a language scope. This attribute is optional. 
\item {\itshape Term}\-: The master, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Term()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}} tag, is a reference to another term that hosts the attributes of the current term. This can be used to redirect synonymous terms to a single instance that holds all the attributes common to the referencing terms. This is used to prevent duplicating attributes for synonym terms. This attribute is constituted by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D} of the referenced term and is optional. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape The native identifier of the term, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-I\-D}, is equivalent to the global identifier, in derived classes the native identifier will generally be a hash of the global identifier.}

{\itshape Once the object has been committed, besides the global and native identifiers, also the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E\-S\-P\-A\-C\-E} and \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-I\-D} attributes will be locked, since they are used to generate the unique identifier.}

{\itshape The object will have its \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Inited()} status set if the local identifier, \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-I\-D}, is set.}

\item {\itshape User role}\-: The user role, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Role()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-U\-S\-E\-R\-\_\-\-R\-O\-L\-E}} tag, is a string that represents the user role or credentials, it is a system dependent element that provides the host system with the necessary information to provide the user the correct privileges. 
\item {\itshape User profile}\-: The user profile, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{Profile()}} or the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-U\-S\-E\-R\-\_\-\-P\-R\-O\-F\-I\-L\-E}} tag, is a set of elements that list the capabilities or credentials of the user.

{\itshape This class represents a web-\/services wrapper server, it is the ancestor of web-\/service classes in this library.}

{\itshape Wrappers are objects that respond to standard web calls and receive parameters in both {\itshape G\-E\-T} and {\itshape P\-O\-S\-T} parameters, the main two parameters handled by this class are\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-F\-O\-R\-M\-A\-T}} (required)\-: The data format of the response,it will be returned as\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-P\-H\-P}}\-: A P\-H\-P-\/serialised string. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-J\-S\-O\-N}}\-: A J\-S\-O\-N-\/serialised string. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-E\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N}} (required)\-: The requested operation, each class will implement specialised handlers, this class only implements the following two operations\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-H\-E\-L\-P}}\-: A {\itshape L\-I\-S\-T-\/\-O\-P} command, this command will return in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-S\-P\-O\-N\-S\-E} section the list of supported operations as an array structured as follows\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape index}\-: The index will be the operation code. 
\item {\itshape value}\-: The value will be the operation description. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-P\-I\-N\-G}}\-: A {\itshape P\-I\-N\-G} command, this can be used to check if a service is alive. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape If both the above parameters are present, the service will return an array constituted by the following three sections\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S}}\-: {\itshape Operation status}. This section is returned by default and will inform on the status of the requested operation. It consists of an array containing the following elements\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-L\-E\-V\-E\-L}}\-: {\itshape Response status}. This element will be returned by default regardless of the operation outcome. This corresponds to the severity of the response and it can take the following values\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-I\-D\-L\-E}}\-: This is the status of the web-\/service before any operation has been executed, or when the operation was successful; this is the response of a successful \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-P\-I\-N\-G} request. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-N\-O\-T\-I\-C\-E}}\-: The operation was successful and a notice message was returned. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E}}\-: The operation was successful and a message was returned. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-W\-A\-R\-N\-I\-N\-G}}\-: The operation was successful but a warning was raised. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-E\-R\-R\-O\-R}}\-: The operation failed because of an error. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-F\-A\-T\-A\-L}}\-: The operation failed because of a fatal error, this will generally mean that the web-\/service is not operational. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-B\-U\-G}}\-: The operation failed because of a bug, the developers should be informed of this kind of errors. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-C\-O\-D\-E}}\-: {\itshape Status code}. This element will be returned by default regardless of the operation outcome. It corresponds to the error code; \hyperlink{}{k\-E\-R\-R\-O\-R\-\_\-\-O\-K} means no error. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E}}\-: {\itshape Status message}. The response message from the operation, this element is used to return informative messages or to return error messages when the service fails. It will generally be formatted as an array in which the index represents the language code in which the message, stored in the element data, is expressed in. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-A\-F\-F\-E\-C\-T\-E\-D\-\_\-\-C\-O\-U\-N\-T}}\-: {\itshape Record count}. The total number of elements affected by the operation. This tag will only be used by derived classes returning data elements. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-E\-R\-M\-\_\-\-N\-O\-T\-E\-S}}\-: {\itshape Attachments}. A list of key/value pairs containing information relevant to the operation response. For instance, if a series of parameters are required and were not provided, this could list them. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T}}\-: {\itshape Service request}. This section will return the actual request provided to the service, this can be used for debugging purposes and will only occur if the optional \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T} parameter has been set to 1. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P}}\-: {\itshape Timers}. This section holds timing information, it will be returned only if you provide the time of day \mbox{[}{\itshape gettimeofday( T\-R\-U\-E )}\mbox{]} in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T} parameter. This section is structured as follows\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T}}\-: Request time stamp, the time in which the request was sent; this is the same value sent by the caller in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T} parameter. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P\-\_\-\-P\-A\-R\-S\-E}}\-: Parse time stamp, the time in which the service finished parsing the request. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P\-\_\-\-S\-E\-N\-T}}\-: Response time stamp, the time in which the response was sent. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-S\-P\-O\-N\-S\-E}}\-: Response, this section will hold the operation response, in this class we only respond to \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-H\-E\-L\-P} list requests. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape Besides the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-F\-O\-R\-M\-A\-T} and \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-E\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N} parameters described in the first section, we have three other optional parameters that can be used to receive specific information sections in the response\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T}}\-: Log the request, if the value of this parameter is 1, the response will contain the received request in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T} section. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-T\-R\-A\-C\-E}}\-: Trace exceptions, if the value of this parameter is 1, in the case of an error that triggered an exception, the error response will also include the call trace. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T}}\-: This parameter should hold the timestamp \mbox{[}{\itshape gettimeofday( T\-R\-U\-E )}\mbox{]} in which the client has sent the request, if provided, the service will return the timing information in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P} section. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape The parameters are expected either in {\itshape G\-E\-T} or {\itshape P\-O\-S\-T}.}

{\itshape If either the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-F\-O\-R\-M\-A\-T} or the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-E\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N} parameters are omitted from the request, the service will return an empty response; this is to prevent unnecessary traffic.}

{\itshape Instances of this class can be considered server objects, and can be implemented with this simple code snippet\-:}

{\itshape {\ttfamily  \$server = new \hyperlink{class_c_wrapper}{C\-Wrapper}( new Server() ); \$server-\/$>$Handle\-Request(); }}

{\itshape An example of this class implementation can be found in the \hyperlink{}{Wrapper.\-php} source file.}
