TAGS:

(Just came to the conclusion (?) that tags are not needed: if a node exists which fills
your requirement, you should use it; if you are working on a test graph, you may tag the
edge as temporary or "test).

(This means that there are two kinds of graphs: serie A which are authoritative and serie B
which are tentative. How do I solve the problem of two ontologies describing the same thing?
With tags?
Preventing it? In this case we need good tools to transfer one branch to another tree.
Tags are needed, because an annotation cannot be explained with a node reference, but With
a sequence of nodes forming a path. Now, should the path be stored as a sequence of
Node/predicate/node...Node? Or a sequence of Term/Predicate term/Term...Term?
Or both?
This means that once a node is created, it cannot be deleted. Not an issue for me...
The bottom line is that we need tags.
Period!
Done!)
